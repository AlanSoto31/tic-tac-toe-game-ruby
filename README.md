## about tic-tac-toe 
Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## about the project
We created the game Tic Tac Toe using Ruby.

The game has a basic interface that runs in the terminal.

The goals of this project are:

- Practice with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) using Ruby.
- Learn how to create and structure a Ruby project.
- Learn to manage the files with correct usage to make code maintainable.
- Practice Git Flow and Github Flow creating branches for different features and for version control.
- This is part of the Odin project curriculum https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop

## game-rules

- Two player game
- Player will have tokens or symbols (X or O)
- Players take turns choosing a cell of the board to mark their symbol.
- A player can only choose an empty cell if not will return an error until input is in an empty cell.
- The first player to complete a succession of 3 of their assigned symbol (O's or X's) in a row, column or diagonal wins!
- If all of the cells are filled with a symbol and no player matched 3 symbols, the game ends in a tie.

## game-instructions

Once you run the game on the terminal, follow the instructions and prompts on screen.
- Both players should enter their preferable name or nickname
- Then it will display your tokens (X or O) and the turns will go accordingly to first and second player
- After the board is displayed the player should input their token accordingly to the empty slot (1 to 9).


## built-with

- Ruby


## setup-for-starting-tic-tac-toe

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## prerequisites
Computer running Mac OS, Windows, or Linux Ubuntu.
Internet browser: Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera...

Have Ruby installed you can see this link for more detailed instructions [Install Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/installing-ruby)

### installation

You MUST have Ruby installed in your system. If you don't have it installed you can go this page [Install Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/installing-ruby)

After that install rspec by typing the command below:

    gem install rspec

After installing ruby, you can download the repo or clone it (paste on the terminal) `git@github.com:AlanSoto31/tic-tac-toe-game-ruby.git`

## run-tic-tac-toe
You will need to execute the main file located inside the bin folder. If you are using Window, follow next step.

## windows

Open the terminal and navigate to the folder using `cd path-to-folder` containing the tic-tac-toe game. Once you are inside, your terminal should look like this: User/<folder>/oop-ruby/. You can type or paste this on terminal `bin/main` to run the game.

## mac-and-linux 

Most Mac and some of Linux computers come with ruby installed, but still need to verify by typing in your terminal `ruby --version` if not please go back to [Installation](#installation) section.

After verifying you have ruby installed and completing the [Installation](#installation) section, open the terminal navigate using `cd path-to-folder` containing the tic-tac-toe game and run in the terminal `bin/main` to run the game.

## how-to-test
