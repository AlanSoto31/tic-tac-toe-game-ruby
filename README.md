## 📐 About The Project
We created the game Tic Tac Toe using Ruby.

The game has a basic interface that runs in the terminal.

The goals of this project are:

- Practice with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) using Ruby.
- Learn how to create and structure a Ruby project.
- Learn to manage the files with correct usage to make code maintainable.
- Practice Git Flow and Github Flow creating branches for different features and for version control.
- This is part of the Odin project curriculum https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop

## 📋 Game Rules

- Two player game
- Player will have tokens or symbols (X or O)
- Players take turns choosing a cell of the board to mark their symbol.
- A player can only choose an empty cell if not will return an error until input is in an empty cell.
- The first player to complete a succession of 3 of their assigned symbol (O's or X's) in a row, column or diagonal wins!
- If all of the cells are filled with a symbol and no player matched 3 symbols, the game ends in a tie.
